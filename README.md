## About
Creating a flappy bird clone with pygame by adapting the source code from the reference to get a basic understanding of pygame.

The 3 sounds(flap, point, crash) are made with sfxr. 

The Sprites for the game are made with MS paint. A text file with the coordinates is included.

The executable should only work for the Windows operating system.
